Hello my name is Justin. 1. Passionate 2. Friendly 3. Curious. My favorite hobby is playing the guitar. This is because I've been playing it for over 17 years and I still have fun playing it. The guitar can make many different sounds and is able to convey a wide spectrum of moods and feelings for being a very versatile instrument capable of being modified. I have owned different brands of guitar and each individual instrument had unique characteristics to it which added to my curiosity for my hobby - some guitars had maple fretboards while others rosewood, etc. The sound produced is dependent on many different parts.
